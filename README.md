## Entry Points for Contributors

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character prepares a meal from their homeland, with each step triggering a specific, non-linear memory of political upheaval.
- Create a dialogue between two exiles: one who fills silence with noise and community, and one who preserves it with ritual and order.
- Draft a 'found document'—a letter, speech fragment, or bulletin—from the revolutionary father, Kwame Asare, that his son Kofi discovers.
- Describe a character's mundane workplace (like the council office) as a physical manifestation of the bureaucratic decay they fled, contrasting it with a flash of remembered idealism.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Minimalist Narrative Engine' that generates a daily ritual (like preparing yam) and pairs it algorithmically with a pseudo-random, thematically-linked memory from a database of exile experiences.
- Create a text-based environment simulator for Kofi's room, where interactive objects (lockbox, radio, photograph) reveal fragments of the story through descriptive prose and embedded audio clips of remembered sounds.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: J.M. Coetzee (for minimalist austerity and the politics of silence), Teju Cole (for the diasporic consciousness and intellectual exile), Aminatta Forna (for the legacy of political trauma and precise, sensory detail), Georges Perec (for the obsessive documentation of the everyday and the architecture of constraint)
